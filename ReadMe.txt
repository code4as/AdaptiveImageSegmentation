*** Project.m is the main file which needs to be run. 

*** Along with Project.m there are three other .m files, namely grow.m, merge.m          and boundary_elimination.m, which provide functionality to the project. 

*** We have used 'imwrite()' function in the Project.m class which needs to have the      permissions to create a file in the current directory. So please place the files      in the appropriate folders. (i.e.) if the current directory is C:/ then               preferably change it to the Desktop and change the path of matlab.
